// Package aec provides acoustic echo cancellation for the mic pipeline
// using the speexdsp echo canceller (MDF/AUMDF), vendored from
// https://github.com/xiph/speexdsp tag SpeexDSP-1.2.1 (libspeexdsp/, BSD).
//
// The canceller consumes two streams: the near-end mic signal (16kHz mono
// S16, 512-sample periods — the beamformer's output, pre-NS/AGC) and a
// far-end reference of what the speaker is playing. The reference is tapped
// at the ALSA write in the speaker silence loop (48kHz stereo S16, every
// period *including silence*, so the reference clock advances in lockstep
// with playback), downmixed and 3:1 box-decimated to 16kHz mono here, and
// buffered in a ring the mic goroutine drains one period at a time.
//
// Alignment: both PCM devices sit on the same codec clock, so the streams
// cannot drift — but mic capture overruns (the mic ALSA ring is only 160ms
// deep; any longer stall of the reader loses whole batches) leave the ring
// with excess reference, which the occupancy governor in Process trims
// back to the nominal delay. The delay models write-to-ear latency (ALSA output
// buffering ~340ms at 4×2048 frames / 48kHz, minus input-side buffering);
// the echo filter tail only has to absorb the residual mismatch plus room
// reverb, not the whole pipeline latency.
